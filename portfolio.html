                <p class="lion">Lionup is a sports calendar and organization application for your average players to make your sporting experience easier and more enjoyable. This idea for the app stemmed from problems I experienced playing different levels of hockey. From unorganized coaches, wrong game locations, absence of players, to skewing the stat sheet (if any), there are always little things that can make your sporting experience better. </p>

We came up with a two-gauge process where we would make the website more advanced yet assessible and also be active in events such as Canada day. The challenge of this assignment was to use design thinking strategies to better understand the residents of Brantford and implement an innovative way to engage them in lowering their emissions to fight climate change. </p>

University and College students can often feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they have and may feel as if they simply don’t have enough time to be social and meet new people. Our service wants to fix that. The application Interlinked uses maps and locations to organize events from schools and students in an accessible way.

After research and idea generation I came up with “Thursdays in the fairway”. The idea came from playing golf and aiming for the fairway because that is that place you wanted your ball to be. The target audience is your average golfer that is possibly craving food after playing many holes of golf.  </p>
